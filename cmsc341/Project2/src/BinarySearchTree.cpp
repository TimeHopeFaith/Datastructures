* Description:
*
* This is a generic Binary Search Tree class provided by Mr. Lupoli
* It has the following changes by me:
* - Moved the Binary Node and the insert function from private to protected.
* 
* This CPP file is empty because the Binary Search Tree was given completely in the header file.
* This is purely for compiling.
